Step 1: Identify Key Symptoms
Carefully examine the vignette and extract all key symptoms experienced by the individual.
Note the severity, duration, and onset of each symptom.
Highlight any context, such as triggering events or stressors, that may contribute to these symptoms.

Step 2: Broad Symptom Analysis
Group the symptoms into possible related domains (e.g., mood symptoms, anxiety symptoms, stress symptoms).
Maintain flexibilityâ€”do not decide on a specific category yet. Instead, keep all potential areas open for evaluation.

Step 3: Compare Across Diagnostic Criteria
Evaluate the identified symptoms against the diagnostic criteria across all categories (mood, anxiety, stress, etc.).
For each relevant symptom group, assess if it meets the diagnostic criteria for any disorders in each domain.
For example, if symptoms involve anxiety and mood disturbances, evaluate against both anxiety and mood disorder criteria.

Step 4: Differential Analysis
Consider overlapping symptoms across different diagnostic categories:
Are any symptoms common to multiple disorders?
Assess whether one category better explains the overall pattern of symptoms, considering the context and impact.
Rule out conditions based on inconsistencies or lack of sufficient criteria.

Step 5: Functional Impact
Assess the overall impact of the symptoms on the individual's functioning:
Consider personal, social, and occupational domains.
Identify which symptoms have the most significant impact and whether they point toward a particular diagnosis.

Step 6: final Diagnosis and Summary
1. Based on the reasoning and analysis above, provide the final diagnosis. If no diagnosis is warranted, state that explicitly.
2. List of Potential Diagnoses:
2.1.Stress Disorders: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, Prolonged Grief Disorder, Adjustment Disorder, Acute Stress Reaction, Other Disorder Specifically Associated with Stress.
2.2.Mood Disorders: Bipolar type I, Bipolar type II, Cyclothymic Disorder, Single Episode Depressive Disorder, Recurrent Depressive Disorder, Dysthymic Disorder, Mixed Depressive and Anxiety Disorder, Other Specified Mood Disorder.
2.3.Anxiety Disorders: Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Agoraphobia, Specific Phobia, Social Anxiety Disorder, Separation Anxiety Disorder, Selective Mutism, Other Anxiety and Fear-Related Disorder.
3. Provide a summary of the reasoning that led to this diagnosis, emphasizing the key symptoms, context, and why they fit within a specific diagnostic category.
